# BanglishTools

BanglishTools is made for converting badly/differently written Banglish text (Bengla written in English) into English Text.
I have used Avro to translate from Banglish phonetic to Bangla excluding English words. 

For example: 

original   >> Ki kore booking dete hoy

banglish   >> ki kore booking dite hoy

translated >> কি করে booking দিতে হয়

english    >> How to make a booking


As of write now there is no other tool on the internet to translate this sort of badly formated banglish text to Bangla. 


Known Issues: 

1. Some Bangla spellings are wrong.
2. Context of the sentence changes sometimes when translated.
3. Some English words are not detected as English words.
