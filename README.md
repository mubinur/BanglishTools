# BanglishTools

BanglishTools is made for converting badly/differently written Banglish text (Bengla written in English) into English Text.
I have used Avro to translate from Banglish phonetic to Bangla excluding English words. 

For example: 

original   >> Ki kore booking dete hoy\n
banglish   >> ki kore booking dite hoy\n
translated >> কি করে booking দিতে হয়\n
english    >> How to make a booking\n


As of write now there is no other tool on the internet to translate this sort of badly formated banglish text to Bangla. 
I will work on it further to fix all the issues and make it more accurate. 



Known Issues: 

1. Some Bangla spellings are wrong.
2. Context of the sentence changes sometimes when translated.
3. Some English words are not detected as English words.
